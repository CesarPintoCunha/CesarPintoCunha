Hey, I'm César 


I just need a cup of coffee ☕️ and the game 🎮 is on. Ready for the next challenge. 
Programming allows me to work on problem solving and motivates me to continue to learn more and more and that's why I can't think of anything else I would rather do.
Life’s too short for bad coffee and for boring work!
